# Prep: The Growth Mindset

## Emotional Intelligence

While assessing my emotional intelligence for a second time, I see that I have grown in several categories but I still have much room for continued growth.  My self, and social awareness are just barely below the mark for a satisfactory score. my self management is much lower and absolutely must be improved.  Self management is the category I knew I would have an issue with as it has always been an issue. My relationship management is an area where I supposedly am satisfactory.  Though I still believe I could grown and improve in that category as well. To improve where I need to most I will continue to learn about the growth mindset and emotional intelligence, which are all newer terms to me. And I will implement them wherever possible to help myself become more emotionally intelligent. 

## Biases

I believe we all have biases. In some situations they are taught, in others they are societal, and even others are from experience. While I feel that I personally am a fairly unbiased person, I'm sure I have room to grow in some situations. I try in every circumstance to treat everyone with the same understanding and empathy.  I know that I can learn something from everyone I meet.  We are all coming from different places in life. We can not assume that everyone has the same opportunities, same education, same upbringing, and have lived the same lives that we have.
