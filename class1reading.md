### Markdown
Q. What is Markdown?  
A. Markdown is a markup language for generating HTML using textual symbols for structure

#### Examples
* Mark down will us the (#) symbol to indicate header size rather than HTML using H1.
* using more (#) symbols (###) changes the size of the header just as H1, H2, H3 does in HTML.
* using a symbol such as an asterisk *will change the writing style to italics*, or if used at the beginning of a sentance will create bullet points.
* using two asterisk **will change the style to bold**.
