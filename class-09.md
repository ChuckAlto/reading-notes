## Events

from Javascript and Jquery by Jon Duckett on page 244
> When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events.  It's the browser's way of saying, " Hey, this just happened." Your scripts can then respond to these events.
Events make a website more interactive for the end user by responding to the user and changing something on the page.
The three steps to trigger an event.
1. the element that the event responds to must be chosen.
2. What type of event must be specified.
3. you must tell what code is to be run when the event if triggered.
