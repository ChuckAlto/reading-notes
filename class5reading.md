# CSS!  

## What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is used to decorate the HTML framework to make a more stylized and interesting website.  Amongst many other style choices you can use CSS to...  
* Color text  
* Set backgrounds  
* Change text into different columns  
* Change the size of text  
* make animations  

### CSS Syntax  
Declarations are the changes you want to make to a certain aspect of your site such as text color and size. They sit in `{ }` and are made up of a Property and a value.  

Property is the name given to the part of an element we would like to change. for example, if we want text to be a certain color the property would be called `color` if we want text to be a certain size the property would be called `font-size`.  After a property is established a `:` is used and then the property is given a value.  

Value is the color or the font size that we would like the property to be.  if we wanted the color to be black then inside the `{ }` we would write the property `color` and then a `:` and then the word `black` for value.  You then end the css command with a `;` fully looking like this,  
`{`  
    `color: black;`  
 `}`  

Of course we must tell CSS what we want to be changed.  using this same example we will assume we want the h1 in the header to be changed.  The CSS code would look the same be you will begin it with an h1 tag to let CSS know what we are changing.  

`h1 {`  
    `color: black;`  
    `}`
