## Structure
Structure refers to the way a something is presented to be best understood.  whether it be a newspaper story, a website, or an html code.  html code uses tags such as `header` `body` `footer` as containers that help organize your code and make it easy to read.  Most of these tags have an opening and a closing tag.  A closing tag means it is the end of that container.

## Extra Markup
### Doctype
Every html document should indicate to the text editor that it is an html file.  The way to do this is `<doctype html>` a the very top of the code.  
### Comments
It is good practice to leave notes in your code.  Whether they be to your future self or to your team. Notes allow you to explain why you wrote a certain peice of code.  to do this you have to begin the note with `<!--` and end it with `-->` This allows a note to exist within the code but not effect what the end user sees.  This is also a good way to temporarily disable an element of your code.
### ID attributes
If you have multiple elements in your code that have the same tag, it is best practice to give them an ID attribute to be able to identify them individually if you have to change the style of the elements indiviually using CSS. To do this you code `id='something'` where something is the value that allows CSS to know what element to effect.

## Design
A websites design is of critical importance.  While you want to reach the widest audience possible, it is also important to consider who is most likely going to be using your website/service. Then you cater your website in the direction of that demographic.  You must consider things like age, gender, income, and geographic location.  If you have a landscaping business in the Pittsburgh suburbs it may not be in your interest to have a website that caters to people in rural China. The design of your website is important not only visually but also contextually.  Does your website convey a simple and concise message? Will people be confused when they are on your site? Will people be able to find the information they are looking for? All of these design element need to be considered before the coding even begins.
