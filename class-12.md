## Charts

Making a chart on your website is better than a standard table because they are better at displaying data, they make the site look more professional, they are easy to look at and easier to read data.
Making a chart can be much easier using a pre-made chart from a library.  A easy chart plug in comes from chart.js.  With chart.js you just copy and paste code into your code and that will bring into your code a library of information that chart.js uses to render the graph.  You set the parameters of the graph, what kind of graph it is, for example a bar chart or a pie chart.  You then tell the chart what information it is conveying and where to get it.  You can also use CSS to style the chart to your liking. Changing the colors, borders, background colors, etc.
