# Operators

Javascript has many different types of operators. They work by having one or more operands for the operator.
* Assignment
* Comparison
* Arithmetic
* Bitwise
* Logical
* String
* Conditional
* Comma
* Unary
* Relational

##Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign a value to an operand based on another operand value
`x = y` means x is assigned the same value as y.
`x += y` means x equals x plus y.

## Comparison Operators
Comparison Operator Compare operands returning a boolean value. These can work for numbers, and strings.
`x==y` false
`x==x` true

## Arithmetic Operators
Work basically the same as most standard arithmetic with some additional operators.  Beside the standard `+` add, `-`subtract `*`multiply `/` divide, there are also many others, some can be viewed in class reading 7.  Other arithmetic operators can turn a string into a number `+"5"` turns into `5` 

## String Operators
String operators work on strings, they can concatenate the strings using `+`
`("this" + "that") = "this that"`

# Loops
Loops let you repeat some action.
