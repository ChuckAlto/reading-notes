# JAVASCRIPT!  
Javascript is a programming language that allows your to make web pages interactive.  It improves the users experience by making a static web page an interactive web page.

## Variables
there are three commands to set variables.  
* var  
* let  
* const  
### var  
  

using the `var` command you set or declare a variable.  at this point the variable has no value it is just a placeholder for a variable to come.  
`var yourname;` declares yourname as the variable but it contains nothing.  
`yourname = "bob"` gives the variable yourname the value of bob.  you can also name a variable or several variables and also give them values at the same time.  
`var yourname = "bob", yourlname = "smith"`  

variable values can be text or numbers or text with numbers but they are treated differently.  

when giving value to a declared variable, "text" will be wrapped in `""`, this is called a string.  numbers can also be written in `""` but they will no long be recognized as numbers. Numbers need to be without `""` as in,
`var age = 41;  this declares age as the variable and 41 as a number value for age.

A variable without a value is considered `value undefined`.  Sometimes a variable will remain undefined because it requires a users imput to define the value.

### let  

the let variable acts differently to the var variable.  using the var variable you are able to over wright the value of a declared variable whether it is dont by accident or on purpose.  Let does not allow this. Once a let variable is given a value that value can not be redefined.
