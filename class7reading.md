## Control Flow  
The order that a computer executes commands is called control flow.  From the first command to the last the computer runs code in order unless acted upon by another force in the way of loops or coonditionals.

## Functions
A Function is code that performs a called upon task. A function is defined with the word function and then given a name.
`function thatfunction`
that is then followed by `()`
`function thatfunction()`
function names follow the same rules as variable names.
Parameters are names that are listed inside the function `()`
`function thatfunction(name1, name2)`
What is to be executed is then placed inside `{}`
`function thatfunction(name1, name2){`
   ` do this`
`}`
An Argument is what is the result of the function.

A function executes when the funtion is called upon in some way. whether that be an automatic function or a user called upon function.
