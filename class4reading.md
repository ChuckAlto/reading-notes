## Wireframe and Design
when creating a website it is important to have a simple easy to understand and navigate blueprint before you begin adding any style.  If a user can't navigate your site, then all the style in the world wont help your finished product.  This is where a wireframe comes in handy.  a wireframe is a simple blueprint for what you would like to create.  The simplist way to make this is with pen and paper. The wireframe itself should dispaly all that you want to achieve for the website, and be able to answer any questions the user might have when visiting the website.  

## HTML  
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.  It is the language that is used to create a website.  It is more complicated than markdown but allows you to create a much more stylish website.  HTML uses letters, or words to write the code rather than the symbols of markup.

## Semantics  
In coding, semantics refers to what a piece of code actually does, what effect that particular code has on the final product. Even though there are different ways to accomplish the same effect, it is important to use the semantically correct way for a particular job.  Using the correct semantic element makes reading code easier and keeps the code itself cleaner and simpler.
